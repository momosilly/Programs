            <h3>A Note on Roasting</h3>
            <p>When coffee beans are roasted, chemical reactions like caramelization and the Maillard reaction occur, creating the flavors and aromas that make coffee so distinctive.</p>
            </div>
        <div class="roast green">
            <h4>Green Beans</h4>
            <p class="temp">22C°(72F°)</p>
            <p>Green coffee is made from the raw, unroasted seeds of the coffee fruit. Unlike the familiar brown beans, these are simply dried and processed without undergoing roasting. Because they haven&rsquo;t been roasted, green coffee beans retain more of their natural compounds&mdash;especially chlorogenic acid, which tends to decrease during roasting. Although it can be brewed, green coffee has a sharp, grassy flavor and is more often used in health products as an extract due to its potential wellness benefits</p>
        </div>
        <div class="roast light">
            <h4>Light Roast</h4>
            <p class="temp">205C°(401F°)</p>
            <p>Light roast coffee is made by roasting beans at lower temperatures for a shorter time. This gentle process produces pale brown beans with a dry, matte surface and helps preserve the natural qualities of the original coffee. The result is a brew with lively, intricate flavors&mdash;often floral or fruity&mdash;with noticeable acidity and a clean, tea-like texture. Unlike darker roasts, light roasts don&rsquo;t carry strong, smoky or chocolatey notes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="roast city">
            <h4>City Roast</h4>
            <p class="temp">219C°(426F°)</p>
            <p>City roast is a light-to-medium roast level where beans are heated until the first audible crack finishes, but before the second one begins. This careful timing results in dry, pale brown beans that preserve the bean&rsquo;s natural acidity and showcase vibrant, fruity notes. With a lighter body and a clean finish, city roasts are ideal for brewing methods like pour-over, which bring out the subtle flavors tied to the bean&rsquo;s origin</p>
        </div>
        <div class="roast vienna">
            <h4>Vienna Roast</h4>
            <p class="temp">230C°(446F°)</p>
            <p>Vienna roast is a medium-dark roast that sits between a standard medium roast and the deeper French roast. The beans are dark brown with a slight sheen of oil, and the flavor is smooth and well-rounded, often featuring hints of chocolate, toasted nuts, and a touch of caramel sweetness. Roasted just as the second crack begins, this level produces a rich, full-bodied cup with lower acidity and a subtle smoky undertone. Its balanced profile makes it a great fit for a variety of coffee styles</p>
        </div>
        <div class="roast italy">
            <h4>Italian Roast</h4>
            <p class="temp">245C°(473F°)</p>
            <p>Italian roast takes coffee beans to one of the darkest roast levels, even deeper than French roast. The intense heat gives the beans a nearly black appearance with a glossy, oily surface. This roast produces a bold, full-bodied flavor with smoky undertones and a slightly burnt edge, offering a rich taste that&rsquo;s both strong and layered.</p>
